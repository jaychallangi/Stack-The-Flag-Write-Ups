First I created an account. Then I viewed the other users on the site. The difference between my account and the other account was
a UID number at the end of the url. My account was 3 and the account in question, Bob's, was 2. When I tried to access Bobs key with simple url 
manipulation to change the UID to 2, I got to the unoauthorized page. Then I tried adding another uid parameter to the request key page. I
set one uid to the account I was on and the second uid to Bob's. With this i was able to access bobs account.
